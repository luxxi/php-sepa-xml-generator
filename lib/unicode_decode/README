Unidecode is a PHP version of the perl module Text::Unicode.
It takes UTF-8 data and tries to represent it in US-ASCII characters
(i.e., the universally displayable characters between 0x00 and 0x7F).
The representation is almost always an attempt at transliteration
-- i.e., conveying, in Roman letters, the pronunciation expressed by the text in some other writing system.

See data/perl_source/README for the original README file, including methodology and limitations.

Note that all the files named 'x??.php' in data are derived directly from the equivilent perl file,
and both sets of files are distributed under the perl license, and not the BSD license.
